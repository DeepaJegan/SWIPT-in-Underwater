## ðŸ“„ Description

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the improved SWIPT (Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer) schemes proposed in the paper *Improved SWIPT Schemes for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs)*.

Traditional PS-SWIPT and TS-SWIPT cooperative NOMA schemes do not fully utilize distance-dependent bandwidth in underwater environments.  

In this work, we propose two enhanced methods:

- **IPS-SWIPT-CNOMA**: Improved Power Splitting scheme  
- **ITS-SWIPT-CNOMA**: Improved Time Switching scheme  

These methods exploit additional bandwidth for enhanced energy harvesting, resulting in a **positive energy balance** to support energy-limited UASNs.
